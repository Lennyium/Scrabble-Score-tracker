## üßÆ How It Works

1. **Letter Scoring**  
   Each letter is assigned a point value (e.g. A=1, B=3, C=3, etc.). Both uppercase and lowercase letters are supported.

2. **Score Calculation**  
   The `score_word()` function returns the total score for a given word.

3. **Tracking Player Words**  
   A dictionary called `player_to_words` keeps track of each player and the words they‚Äôve played.

4. **Score Updating**  
   The `update_point_totals()` function calculates total points for each player and updates `player_to_points`.

5. **Adding New Words**  
   The `play_word()` function adds a new word for a player and updates their score.
